# Project 1 - Health Data Management System

## 1. Project Introduction

The system is designed to help users record, analyze and manage health data, display health trends through charts, and provide personalized health advice based on user data. The system is suitable for fitness enthusiasts, patients with chronic diseases (such as high blood pressure) and medical personnel. Users can input data such as weight, blood pressure, heart rate, exercise, sleep, etc., set daily health reminders, and import data from smart devices or export reports for doctors' reference.

## 2. **Business Requirements**

### Goal

To help users fully understand their health status and adjust their lifestyle in time according to data feedback to prevent or improve health problems.

### Key Features

* **Health Data Recording:** Users can input data such as weight, blood pressure, heart rate, exercise, and sleep.
* **Data Visualization:** Use charts and trend graphs to help users visually understand the changes in their health status.
* **Health Reminders:** Provide daily reminders (e.g., to drink water, take medication, or exercise) to improve the efficiency of health management.
* **Personalized Health Advice:** Based on data analysis, offer tailored advice on diet, exercise, and lifestyle adjustments.
* **Data Import/Export:** Support importing data from smart devices and exporting health reports for reference by doctors.

### Associations

* **User and Its Extended Classes:**
  * The User class serves as the base class for all users. Its extended classes include FitnessEnthusiast, Patient, and Doctor. These extended classes inherit all the basic attributes and associations defined in the User class.
* **Association between User and HealthData:**
  * Each User can have multiple HealthData records.
  * This is a one-to-many composition relationship, which means that each HealthData instance must be associated with a User. If a User is deleted, all of the corresponding HealthData records will also be deleted.
* **Association between HealthData and HealthReminder:**
  * Each HealthData can be associated with multiple HealthReminders.
  * This relationship is a one-to-many aggregation, indicating that while HealthReminders are connected to a HealthData, they can exist and be managed independently within the system.
* **Association between HealthData and HealthAdvice:**
  * Each User can have multiple HealthAdvice entries.
  * This one-to-many composition is used to store or generate personalized health advice for the user, based on their recorded health data.

## 12. Acknowledgment

I used external tools to build the UML diagrams and Mockups.

I used GenAI of ChatGPT-4 for this project.

Prompt: What the association between each classes?

Response:

Associations:

User and Its Extended Classes:

The User class serves as the base class for all users. Its extended classes include FitnessEnthusiast, Patient, and Doctor. These extended classes inherit all the basic attributes and associations defined in the User class

Association between User and HealthData:

Each User can have multiple HealthData records.

This is a one-to-many composition relationship, which means that each HealthData instance must be associated with a User. If a User is deleted, all of the corresponding HealthData records will also be deleted.

Association between HealthData and HealthReminder:

Each HealthData can be associated with multiple HealthReminders.

This relationship is a one-to-many aggregation, indicating that while HealthReminders are connected to a HealthData, they can exist and be managed independently within the system.

Association between HealthData and HealthAdvice:

Each HealthData can have multiple HealthAdvice entries.

This one-to-many composition is used to store or generate personalized health advice for the user, based on their recorded health data.

Association between Doctor and Report:

Each Doctor can generate multiple Reports.

This is a one-to-many relationship used to record and present the user's health data and trends over specific time periods.

Association between Doctor and Patient:

As extensions of the User class, Doctor and Patient have a special relationship where a Doctor can be associated with multiple Patients.

This one-to-many relationship facilitates the management and monitoring of multiple patients' health data by a single doctor, allowing doctors to generate, view, and analyze health reports for each patient.

I build the UML diagram to analyze these association and find that they are correct.
